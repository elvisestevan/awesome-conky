#Awesome Conky#
My simple but awesome conky configuration. Feel free to fork and use it yourself. Though it will require some work to setup though.

There are 3 conky configurations as follows:

* conky-core: Displays CPU/RAM/Disk metrics. Does not fetch anything from web.

* conky-social: Displays data from various social networks such as Facebook, Feedly, Github, Stackoverflow, Pocket etc.

* conky-weather: This is a fork of [https://github.com/mariusv/conky-google-now](https://github.com/mariusv/conky-google-now). Full credit to him. I just made minor tweaks like removing extra information to save real estate.
